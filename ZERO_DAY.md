Send to My VanArts with subject jQuery course preparation for cohort 17

I am the teacher for the jQuery course on Wednesday afternoons. The first class may or may not be taught remotely, so please prepare yourself for the first class

The main communication for this course is through my Slack workspace https://domaindesign.slack.com/

### Preparation

1. Signup for a new account on my Slack workspace https://join.slack.com/t/domaindesign/shared_invite/enQtOTc4MjI5NjU4ODA3LWI2MTY1NWMzODY5ZTU2OGQxY2FhZTc3MmMxN2UxMWE5MWVmYmM1ZTExMzdjOWI5NjliMDYzNDI5YTdmZGNmY2Y
    - If you already have a Slack account, you still need to create a new account for my workspace as each workspace is separate from each other.
2. Provide your GitHub username to me on Slack via Direct Message
