// jQuery course preparation for cohort 18

I am the teacher for the jQuery course on Friday mornings. The first class will be taught remotely, so please prepare yourself with the appropriate tools.

The main communication for this course is through my Slack workspace https://domaindesign.slack.com/

### Preparation

1. Signup for a new account on my Slack workspace https://join.slack.com/t/domaindesign/shared_invite/zt-gx62d65u-EdZ0qgCPCNPgW~WE~0pPWw
- If you already have a Slack account, you still need to create a new account for my workspace as each workspace is separate from each other.
2. Provide your GitHub username to me on Slack via Direct Message
- If a new GitHub account is needed then create one https://github.com/join
